# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Django

Welcome to my shiny new running Django! I've got everything fired up and running for you to explore Django.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. There's a single initial commit with what you're seeing right now - where you go from here is up to you!

Everything you do here is contained within this.

## installing dependancies

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## To collect static files:
